# -Business-Insights-Dashboard
Excited to share my recent data analysis project where I transformed raw data into actionable insights using Microsoft Excel! ðŸ“Š
I created  interactive dashboards to provide valuable Business Insights :
Business Insights Dashboard:

1. At first graphical chart I represented the comparison for Average discount rate and Profit margin by each customer segment by stacked bar chart and I added a slicer of Product category to derive insights for each products.
2. In second graph I compared Average Sales and Quantity sold by customer segment Combo chart and added a slicer for region so that I can make decision for each region as needed.
3. In third graph I have applied payment method for each sales channel by each customer segment slicer , I used clustered bar chart to visualize it.
4. In fourth case I compared which payment method derive most profit margin By adding a slicer for each city so that I can make decision represented by Line chart.
5. In fifth step I have added a Calculation method for Profit Margin after adding sales amount and quantity sold values to the cell , I can find profit margin for the given values.


At finally , I have done some formatting in cells , slicer and graphs to looks more attractive.

Leveraging Excel's powerful tools, I was able to:

1.Clean and prepare the data for analysis.
2.Perform various statistical calculations and analyses.
3.Create visually appealing and informative dashboards.

This project has strengthened my skills in data analysis and visualization. Looking forward to applying these techniques to future projects and contributing to data-driven decision-making.
