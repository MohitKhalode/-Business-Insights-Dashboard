# -Business-Insights-Dashboard
Excited to share my recent data analysis project where I transformed raw data into actionable insights using Microsoft Excel! ðŸ“Š
I created two interactive dashboards to provide valuable Business Insights and Bank churn Insights:

Business Insights Dashboard:

1. At first graphical chart I represented the comparison for Average discount rate and Profit margin by each customer segment by stacked bar chart and I added a slicer of Product category to derive insights for each products.
2. In second graph I compared Average Sales and Quantity sold by customer segment Combo chart and added a slicer for region so that I can make decision for each region as needed.
3. In third graph I have applied payment method for each sales channel by each customer segment slicer , I used clustered bar chart to visualize it.
4. In fourth case I compared which payment method derive most profit margin By adding a slicer for each city so that I can make decision represented by Line chart.
5. In fifth step I have added a Calculation method for Profit Margin after adding sales amount and quantity sold values to the cell , I can find profit margin for the given values.

Bank Churn Dashboard:

1. In the Bank churn project firstly I have represented Average account Balance for each gender by countries, Here I used stacked bar chart and added a slicer churn values (1, 0) i.e. Boolean value as mention in data where 1 means churned and 0 means not churned.
2. In second graph I represented churned rated by product and services used by customers for each geographic location slicer , For this I used Line chart.
3. In third case I derived that How many active and non-active customers who having credit cards which used again Boolean values for true and false for gender male and female by slicer, I visualize it by clustered chart.
4. In fourth graph I can find Average credit scores of customers by their different tenure and adding a slicer of Age variable to check and make the appropriate decision , I used custom combination chart to represent it.
5. At the Bottom of our dashboard I have added a segment for churn data of customer by selection their customer id's which can be selected by clicking on dropdown list ðŸ‘†.

At finally , I have done some formatting in cells , slicer and graphs to looks more attractive.

Leveraging Excel's powerful tools, I was able to:

1.Clean and prepare the data for analysis.
2.Perform various statistical calculations and analyses.
3.Create visually appealing and informative dashboards.

This project has strengthened my skills in data analysis and visualization. Looking forward to applying these techniques to future projects and contributing to data-driven decision-making. hashtag#dataanalysis hashtag#businessintelligence hashtag#bankchurn hashtag#datascience hashtag#dataanalysis hashtag#excel hashtag#businessinsights hashtag#dashboards hashtag#datavisualization hashtag#projectcompletion hashtag#learningnewskills hashtag#professionaldevelopment hashtag#exceldashboard hashtag#excelcharts hashtag#datacleansing hashtag#datastorytelling hashtag#datascience hashtag#analytics
